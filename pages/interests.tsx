It is a CLI to pull weather data from a Vantage PRO2 console, a very popular weather station console within yacht clubs here in Australia.

We both loved it and kept taking classes, training and occasionally going out to social tango nights.</Text>
                        <Text>We even started a YouTube channel where we post some of our training videos and describe the experience and life teachings that come from it.</Text>
