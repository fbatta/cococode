                    <Text fontSize="xs">The original project was written in C, I'm now passing it to Nodejs and adding a few extra bells and whistles. It is a CLI to pull weather data from a Vantage PRO2 console, a very popular weather station console within yacht clubs here in Australia. I aim to also integrate it with a weather API to have real-time weather info available online.</Text>

                <Text>Back in May 2020, in the midst of the first COVID-19 lockdown in Melboure, my partner and I started taking online tango classes with the brilliant <ChakraLink href="https://www.instagram.com/vvmatias/" target="_blank">Matias Van De Voorde</ChakraLink>. We both loved it and kept taking classes, training and occasionally going out to social tango nights.</Text>
                <Text>We even started a YouTube channel where we post some of our training videos and describe the experience and life teachings that come from it.</Text>

                <Text>I'm endlessly fascinated (and deeply scared) by the vastness of the universe, by the unimmaginable scale and weird properties of celestial bodies. I could listen for hours to people explaining all the crazy phenomena that happen in space, and many times I do.</Text>
                <Text>I like astronomy so much that my only (so far at least) tattoo is that of a black hole on my right upper arm.</Text>
