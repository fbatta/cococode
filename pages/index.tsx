            Hello there,

            Thanks for visiting my website! My name's Francesco, I'm an Italian currently living in Melbourne, Australia. I go by many nicknames but my favourite one is Coco.

            While I enjoy smashed avo on toast, in my blood run pasta üçù, pizza üçï, wine üç∑ and short, very black espresso ‚òïÔ∏è.

          <Text>
            Two main reasons really: the first is that I'm looking for a job as a software developer, so I need a place to serve as a content-rich resume.

          <Text>
            Second reason is I also want to start writing a blog about things that I'm passionate about: stuff like tech, IT, electronics, tango dancing, astronomy, books, movies, etc. etc.
