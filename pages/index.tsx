          Hi there,

          Thanks for visiting my website! My name's Francesco, I grew up in Venice, Italy and I currently live in Melbourne, Australia. I go by many nicknames but my favourite one is Coco.

          While I enjoy smashed avo on toast, in my blood run pasta üçù, pizza üçï, wine üç∑ and short, very black espresso ‚òïÔ∏è.

        <Text>
          I want this to be a place where people can get an idea of who I am. Whether you came here as a recruiter trying to decide if I'm worth a job interview, someone in need of help for some software project, or you're simply stumbled upon this site by chance, I hope you'll find what you're looking for.

          I also want to start writing a blog about things that I'm passionate about: stuff like tech, IT, electronics, tango dancing, astronomy, books, movies, etc. etc.

          I've had this idea in my head for a while and thought this is the moment to finally put it into action.
